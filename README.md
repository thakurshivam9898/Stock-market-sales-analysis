# Stock-Market-Data-Analysis-using-LSTM-and-GRU

Objective: The goal of this project was to analyze Reliance Stock data and build predictive models using machine learning techniques to predict stock prices.

Methods: The data was obtained using the nsepy library and the technical indicators such as RSI, volume, etc. were calculated using the talib library. The machine learning models used in this project were Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BILSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The models were trained on historical stock data and the prediction accuracy was evaluated.

Results: The results showed that the predictive models achieved an accuracy of close to 79% in predicting stock prices for Reliance. The LSTM, BILSTM, and GRU models were able to effectively capture the trends and patterns in the stock data and make predictions with high accuracy.
